## Repository Structure

### 1. Backend Services
The backend is implemented in Python and includes the following files:

- **`API_Backend.py`**: A core backend script handling API requests and responses.
- **`backend.py`**: Backend logic implementation.
- **`run_back.py`**: Script to initialize and start backend services.
- **`swarm_script.py`**: Potentially used for container orchestration or swarm management.
- **`test_requests.py`**: A utility script for testing the backend APIs.
- **`input.json`**: A sample input data file for configuration or testing.
- **`api_debug.log`**: Debugging log file for tracking API-related errors and performance.

---

### 2. AI Refactor Plugin
Located in the `AIRefactorPlugin` directory, this component is a Java-based plugin designed for IntelliJ IDEA. It leverages AI to provide suggestions for refactoring Java code and includes:

- **Build and Configuration**:
  - `build.gradle.kts` and `settings.gradle.kts`: Gradle files for project configuration.
  - Gradle wrapper files (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`) and related settings.

- **Source Code**:
  - **Java Files**:
    - `AiRefactorToolWindow.java`: Core implementation for the plugin's user interface.
    - `JavaFile.java` and `RefactorSuggestion.java`: Representations of Java files and AI suggestions.

  - **Resources**:
    - `META-INF/plugin.xml`: Plugin configuration for IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Icons and images for branding (`pluginIcon.svg`, `logo.png`).

---

### 3. Test Code
The `test_codes` directory contains Java test programs that can be used to evaluate the plugin or backend functionality:
- `calculator.java`
- `main.java`
- `person.java`
- `util.java`
